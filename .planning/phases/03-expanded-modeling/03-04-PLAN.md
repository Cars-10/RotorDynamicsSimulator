# Plan: Component Visualization

## Objective
Visually distinguish between different component types and reflect their properties if applicable.

## Execution Context
- **Source**: `src/components/visualizer/`, `src/components/RotorVisualizer.tsx`
- **Goal**: Improve visual feedback for the model.

## Context
Currently, components might look generic. We want bearings to look like bearings (perhaps standard symbols) and seals to look like seals.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Visual Assets**: Create simple SVG or Canvas drawing routines for Bearings (e.g., spring/damper symbol) and Seals.
- [ ] **Update Visualizer**: Modify `RotorVisualizer` (or its sub-components) to render these specific graphics at the component's position.
- [ ] **Interaction**: Ensure clicking the visual representation selects the component (opening the editor from 03-03).

## Success Criteria
- Bearings and Seals are visually distinct on the rotor shaft.
- Visuals scale correctly with the shaft/viewport.

## Output
- Modified `src/components/RotorVisualizer.tsx`
