# Plan: Stability Map Implementation

## Objective
Implement a Stability Map (Logarithmic Decrement) using D3.js to assess rotor stability.

## Execution Context
- **Source**: `src/components/analysis/StabilityMap.tsx`
- **Goal**: Visualize the damping/stability margin across the operating range.

## Context
Rotor stability is as critical as resonance. The Stability Map plots the Logarithmic Decrement ($\delta$) against rotor speed. A positive $\delta$ is stable; negative is unstable. This plot allows engineers to see "how close" they are to instability.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Create Component**: `src/components/analysis/StabilityMap.tsx`.
    - Similar D3 setup to Campbell Diagram (share a common `D3ChartBase` if possible, or duplicate pattern).
- [ ] **Plot Data**: Render Log Dec vs RPM curves for each mode.
- [ ] **Stability Threshold**: Draw a prominent red line at Y=0.
    - Shade the area below Y=0 as "Unstable Zone" (light red background).
- [ ] **Interaction**: Link hovering on the Stability Map to the Campbell Diagram (e.g., highlighting the same mode on both plots).

## Verification
- **Manual**: Verify the plot renders with mock data.
- **Visual**: Ensure the zero-line is clear and unstable modes (if any) dip into the red zone.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Stability Map renders correctly.
- [ ] Y=0 threshold is clearly marked.
- [ ] Unstable regions are visually distinct.
- [ ] Data aligns with the Campbell Diagram (same X-axis range).

## Output
- `src/components/analysis/StabilityMap.tsx`
