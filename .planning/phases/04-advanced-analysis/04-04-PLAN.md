# Plan: Analysis Integration & Dashboard

## Objective
Integrate the analysis tools into a cohesive "Analysis Mode" within the main application.

## Execution Context
- **Source**: `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/analysis/AnalysisDashboard.tsx`
- **Goal**: Provide a seamless workflow between modeling (editing rotor) and analysis (viewing diagrams).

## Context
Currently, the app is in "Design/Simulate" mode. We need a distinct "Analysis" view or a way to toggle these advanced charts. We will replace the bottom "AnalysisTable" or create a new full-screen mode for detailed engineering analysis.

## Tasks
- [ ] **Update App Layout**: Add a top-level toggle or tab for "Design" vs "Analysis".
- [ ] **Dashboard Layout**: Update `AnalysisDashboard.tsx` to arrange `CampbellDiagram` and `StabilityMap` side-by-side or stacked.
- [ ] **Trigger Analysis**: Add a "Run Full Analysis" button in the Sidebar.
    - Connects `useAnalysis` hook to the button.
    - Shows a progress bar/spinner during calculation.
- [ ] **Export**: Add a "Export Report" button that captures the SVG charts and simulation parameters into a PDF-ready format (or just prints to browser print dialog).

## Verification
- **User Flow**:
    1. User models a rotor.
    2. User switches to "Analysis" tab.
    3. User clicks "Run Analysis".
    4. Worker computes.
    5. Charts populate.
    6. User can inspect critical speeds.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] "Analysis" view is accessible.
- [ ] "Run" button triggers the worker and updates charts.
- [ ] Charts are responsive and laid out cleanly.
- [ ] No UI freezing during calculation.

## Output
- `src/App.tsx` (modified)
- `src/components/analysis/AnalysisDashboard.tsx` (finalized)
